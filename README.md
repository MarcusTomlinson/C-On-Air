# C-On-Air
Light-weight C++ web application server library

C++ On Air (or "ConAir") is a light-weight library that combines the power of C++ with the flexibility of Interpp to allow you to create impressive web applications with new / existing C++ code.

ConAir uses an embedded http server and Interpp interpreter to serve html, and process http requests from within your C++ application. This internal server establishes a bidirectional web socket connection between your C++ application and a client-side JavaScript interface for interactive scripting via the web.

Getting started:

1. Download C++ On Air
2. Check out the "example" folder for a demo of how ConAir works
